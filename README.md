what
----

Net::Fritz is a set of Perl modules to communicate with an AVM
Fritz!Box (and possibly other routers as well) via the TR-064
protocol.  The AVM Fritz!Box is a popular home router family in
Germany (and beyond).


why
---

I wanted to use an old analog field telephone with my FritzBox and
VoIP.  While this works quite out-of-the box (it’s just an ordinary
analog phone) for receiving calls, I have no way to dial a number for
outgoing calls.

Luckily the Fritz!Box has a call helper mode where you can tell it to
dial a number and patch it through to any local phone, but I found no
Perl library to use this feature.  So I wrote my own library - the one
you’re looking at right now.


installation
------------

debian/ubuntu packages
apt-get install libxml-simple-perl libappconfig-perl libmoo-perl


The latest release of Net::Fritz can be installed directly from CPAN,
eg. via

    $ cpan -i Net::Fritz

or

    $ cpanm Net::Fritz


building
--------

To build and install the current development version of Net::Fritz
module, you need to have Dist::Zilla installed.  Run the ``dzil``
command - if it is available, Dist::Zilla should be installed.

To install or upgrade Dist::Zilla use

    $ cpan -i Dist::Zilla

or

    $ cpanm Dist::Zilla

Then clone this repository, enter it and start the install process:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mmitch/fritz.git
    $ cd fritz
    $ dzil install

Any missing dependencies should be reported automatically and can be
installed by

    $ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
    $ dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm

Afterwards, try the installation again with

    $ dzil install


where to get it
---------------

Net::Fritz source is hosted at https://github.com/mmitch/fritz  
The latest released version is available on CPAN at
https://metacpan.org/release/Net-Fritz

tool can be seen at https://github.com/mmitch/fritzdial
